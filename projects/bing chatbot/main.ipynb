It is one of three men’s world titles on WWE\\'s main roster, along with the WWE Championship and WWE Universal Championship, which are jointly held and defended as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on SmackDown. The current champion is Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, who defeated AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions on May 27, 2023, to become the inaugural champion.\\n\\nThe title\\'s creation came as a result of Roman Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. After Reigns became undisputed champion in April 2022, he defended the tandem title across both brands, but these defenses were infrequent due to the terms of his contract. With the announcement of the 2023 WWE Draft, the World Heavyweight Championship was unveiled on the April 24, 2023, episode of Raw and subsequently became exclusive to Raw after Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship became exclusive to SmackDown.\\n\\nThe title is distinct from WWE\\'s previous World Heavyweight Championship that was contested from 2002 until 2013 when it was unified into the WWE Championship. The two titles share the same name, but do not share the same lineage.[1]\\n\\nHistory [ edit ]\\n\\nOn the April 24, 2023, episode of WWE\\'s flagship professional wrestling television program, Monday Night Raw, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced the 2023 WWE Draft, a process used by the promotion in which wrestlers are exclusively assigned to compete on a brand. He then addressed Roman Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Since WrestleMania 38 in April 2022, Reigns had held and defended the promotion\\'s two world championships, the WWE Championship and WWE Universal Championship, as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship across both the Raw and SmackDown brands. However, due to his contract, Reigns made infrequent title defenses. Thus, Triple H announced that whichever brand drafted Reigns in the upcoming draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand, while unveiling a new World Heavyweight Championship that would be defended on the opposite brand. It was also revealed that the inaugural champion would be crowned at Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.[2][3] During Night 1 of the draft on the April 28 episode of Friday Night SmackDown, Reigns was drafted to SmackDown, subsequently making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to Raw.[4]\\n\\nDuring the Backlash press conference on May 5, 2023, Triple H announced a tournament for the title including wrestlers from both brands with a bracket for each brand. The first round and semifinals for each bracket were scheduled for the May 8 and May 12 episodes of Raw and SmackDown, respectively. The first-round matches for each episode consisted of two triple threat matches with the respective winners advancing to the semifinals in a singles match the same night, with those respective winners advancing to the championship match at Night of Champions.[5] According to wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, the reason that SmackDown wrestlers were included in the tournament was due to WWE\\'s attempt to retain viewership for the May 12 episode of SmackDown, as it and other wrestling programs that week were going head-to-head with the 2023 NBA playoffs.[6]\\n\\nThe participants for the World Heavyweight Championship Tournament were revealed on May 7 on WWE\\'s YouTube channel: Cody Rhodes, Damian Priest, Finn Bálor, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, Shinsuke Nakamura, and The Miz from Raw, and AJ Styles, Austin Theory, Bobby Lashley, Edge, Rey Mysterio, and Sheamus from SmackDown.[7] On the May 8 episode of Raw, Rollins defeated Nakamura and Priest in the first triple threat while Bálor defeated Miz and Rhodes in the second. Rollins subsequently defeated Bálor in the semifinals to win Raw\\'s bracket.[8] On the May 12 episode of SmackDown, Styles defeated Edge and Mysterio in the first triple threat while Lashley defeated Sheamus and Theory in the second. Styles subsequently defeated Lashley in the semifinals to win SmackDown\\'s bracket, thus setting up the tournament final between Rollins and Styles.[9] At Night of Champions, Rollins defeated Styles to become the inaugural World Heavyweight Champion.[10][11] The title was defended for the first time on the June 5 episode of Raw.[12]\\n\\nInaugural World Heavyweight Championship tournament (2023) [ edit ]\\n\\nBelt design [ edit ]\\n\\nThe World Heavyweight Championship belt has a design that pays homage to the historic Big Gold Belt, which was used for WWE\\'s previous World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013). It also features tributes to previous designs of the company\\'s original world championship, the WWE Championship (1963–present).[13]\\n\\nLike the historic Big Gold Belt, the title has three large gold plates on a black leather strap. All three plates include traditional filigree with each plate outlined in a rope trim to represent the three ropes of a wrestling ring. Like the majority of WWE\\'s other championship belts, the side plates include a removable round center section which can be replaced with the reigning champion\\'s logo in lieu of the nameplate that was found on the original Big Gold Belt; the default side plates feature a gold WWE logo over a globe (customizable side plates were introduced with the 2013–2014 version of the WWE Championship belt).[13]\\n\\nAt the center of the center plate, there is a large globe that has WWE\\'s logo over top of it. The WWE logo is silver with black filled in the blank spaces of the globe. The globe itself represents that the title is defended around the world. Above the globe is a banner with the text \"WORLD\" written in silver with a banner below the globe that says \"CHAMPION\", also in silver. Also on the center plate are three lions, which represent the McMahon family crest (as WWE was founded and owned by the McMahon family until September 2023); there is a full-bodied lion on each opposing side of the globe facing outwards while the third is a lion\\'s head at the very bottom of the center plate (the McMahon family crest was previously included on the side plates of the WWE Championship belts from 1998 to 2005). At the top of the center plate right above the \"WORLD\" banner is a crown, a nod to Bruno Sammartino\\'s WWE Championship belt during his long reign (there was also a crown on the Big Gold Belt). Right above the crown is an eagle, which is an homage to the various WWE Championship belts that included an eagle up until 2013, most notably the Winged Eagle championship belt design (1988–1998). There are a total of 60 diamonds across the three plates; these were in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of WWE, as the company was founded in April 1963 and the title was unveiled in April 2023.[13]\\n\\nReception [ edit ]\\n\\nThe creation of the World Heavyweight Championship was met with mixed reception. Some liked the idea of the title, feeling that it would give new opportunities for several wrestlers, but others were critical.[14][15] Dave Scherer of PWInsider felt that since Roman Reigns was not in the inaugural tournament, it made the World Heavyweight Championship seem like a secondary title to his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.[16] Former WWE and Extreme Championship Wrestling wrestler Tommy Dreamer opined that the title\\'s creation felt like a consolation prize, stating that it gave the impression that nobody could beat Reigns. Nonetheless, he praised the design of the belt.[14] Conversely, WWE Hall of Famer Booker T stated that he did not think it felt like a secondary title or consolation prize, agreeing with the sentiment that it would provide new opportunities, especially for younger wrestlers.[15]\\n\\nWWE commentator Corey Graves said that having the title was great as it would allow Raw and SmackDown to identify as separate brands (as brand division had been lax over the preceding year), but he claimed that until Reigns was defeated, anyone holding the World Heavyweight Championship would feel inferior to Reigns.[17] Scherer also felt that whoever would finally beat Reigns, the impact would be lessened due to the existence of the World Heavyweight Championship.[18] Prior to competing in the tournament final, runner-up AJ Styles said that it was hard to argue that the new title was not secondary compared to Reigns\\' undisputed championship.[19] WWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle also praised the design of the belt, but acknowledged the notion that it felt like a secondary title compared to Reigns\\' titles.[20]\\n\\nReigns [ edit ]\\n\\nAs of February 6, 2024.\\n\\nKey No. Overall reign number Reign Reign number for the specific champion Days Number of days held + Current reign is changing daily\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Men\\'s professional wrestling world championship\\n\\nThe WWE Championship is a men\\'s professional wrestling world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on the SmackDown brand division. Since April 2022, the title has been jointly held and defended with the WWE Universal Championship as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, but both titles have maintained their individual lineages. It is one of three world titles in WWE, alongside its companion Universal Championship on SmackDown, and the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw. The current champion is Roman Reigns, who is in his fourth reign. He won the title by defeating Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match at WrestleMania 38 Night 2 on April 3, 2022, subsequently becoming the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.\\n\\nThe original world championship of the promotion, it was established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on April 25, 1963, as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, after the promotion seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) following a dispute over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers. Since its inception, the title has undergone many name changes due to company name changes and title unifications. It is the oldest championship currently active in WWE, and is presented as being the promotion\\'s most prestigious title, with many matches for the title having headlined pay-per-view and livestreaming events—including WWE\\'s flagship event WrestleMania. In professional wrestling in general, it is considered to be one of the most prestigious championships of all time.[3]\\n\\nFrom its inception until 2001, it was promoted as WWE\\'s sole primary championship. An additional world title, the WCW Championship, was added after the then-World Wrestling Federation\\'s (WWF) purchase of World Championship Wrestling in early 2001. The titles were later unified as the Undisputed WWF Championship. After the first brand split in 2002 and the promotion being renamed to WWE, the championship became exclusive to SmackDown, dropping the \"undisputed\" moniker, while the World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013 version) was created for Raw. ECW became a third brand in 2006, adding the ECW Championship. That title was deactivated in 2010, and the World Heavyweight Championship was unified into the WWE Championship in 2013. The championship was again the sole world title of WWE until the introduction of the Universal Championship with the 2016 brand split and then a new World Heavyweight Championship in 2023. During both brand splits, the WWE Championship has switched brands, usually as a result of the WWE Draft; the 2023 draft moved it back to SmackDown.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOrigin\\n\\nTwo-time champion Bruno Sammartino. His first reign is the longest at over seven years (2,803 days) and he has the longest combined reign (4,040 days); he is pictured here in his second reign (1973–1982 belt design) when the title was known as the WWWF Heavyweight Championship\\n\\nThe title was introduced in 1963 with Buddy Rogers becoming the first champion. However, its origin is attributed to events that began in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which had various territorial member promotions. In the 1950s, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was a member of the NWA and by 1963, its executives held a controlling stake over NWA operations. During this time, Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship until January 24, when Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship in a one-fall match. Claiming the title can only be contested in a traditional two-out-of-three falls match, CWC disputed the title change, and thus seceded from the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was then established and awarded to Buddy Rogers with the explanation that he won a fictional tournament in Rio de Janeiro, supposedly defeating Antonino Rocca in the finals.[4] After several years, the WWWF became affiliated with the NWA once again, and \"World\" was dropped from the championship\\'s name. In 1979, the WWWF was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and then after conclusively ending its affiliation with the NWA in 1983, the championship became known as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although the full name appeared on the championship belts until 1998, the name was often abbreviated to WWF Championship, which became its official name in 1998.\\n\\nMonday Night Wars and title unification\\n\\nA diagram showing the evolution of various world heavyweight championships.\\n\\nIn 1991, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), a member of the NWA, established the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to replace the NWA\\'s world title. In 1993, WCW seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF. Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war, dubbed the Monday Night Wars. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline, which culminated in WWF purchasing WCW in March 2001.[5] As a result of the purchase, the WWF acquired, among other assets, WCW\\'s championships. Thus, there were two world titles in the WWF: the original WWF Championship and the WCW Championship, which was eventually renamed the \"World Championship\".[6][7]\\n\\nIn December 2001, the two championships were unified at Vengeance. At the event, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWF Championship, while Chris Jericho defeated The Rock for the World Championship. After this, Jericho then defeated Austin, unifying the WWF and World Championships, and becoming the first Undisputed WWF Champion; the Undisputed championship retained the lineage of the WWF Championship and the World Championship was retired.[8] Subsequently, the Big Eagle Belt (formerly representing the WWF Championship) and the Big Gold Belt (formerly representing the World Championship) were used in tandem to represent the Undisputed Championship.[9][10][11] Jericho held the championship for four months until he lost it at WrestleMania X8 against Triple H, who was soon after presented with a single championship belt.[12]\\n\\nChampionship disputes\\n\\nRecord 13-time WWE Champion John Cena – shown with the \"Spinner Belt\", which was used to represent the title from 2005 to 2013\\n\\nThe Undisputed Championship continued up through the beginning of the first brand split, which saw wrestlers being drafted to the company\\'s main television programs, Raw and SmackDown, each show representing the brand of the same name, with championships assigned to and authority figures appointed for each brand.[13] The holder of the Undisputed Championship was the only male wrestler allowed to appear on both shows.\\n\\nIn May 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the championships were renamed accordingly. At first, the championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as wrestlers from both brands could challenge the champion. Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of Raw and SmackDown, respectively, Stephanie McMahon convinced then-Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar to become exclusive to the SmackDown brand, leaving the Raw brand without a world title.[14][15] In response, on September 2, Bischoff disputed Lesnar\\'s status as champion, stating Lesnar was refusing to defend his title against the designated No. 1 contender, Triple H, and awarded the latter with the newly created World Heavyweight Championship. Immediately afterwards, Lesnar\\'s championship dropped the epithet \"Undisputed\" and became known as the WWE Championship.[16]\\n\\nOver the course of the first brand split, the WWE Championship was used as the world title of the SmackDown brand twice and of the Raw brand three times. In all but two cases, the WWE Championship switched brands as a result of the annual draft. In June 2006, WWE established ECW as a third brand, on which former Extreme Championship Wrestling stars and newer talent competed. When ECW\\'s Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, the championship briefly became a world title of the ECW brand; the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was subsequently reactivated for the ECW brand upon Van Dam\\'s title win. Van Dam held both titles until he lost the WWE Championship to Raw\\'s Edge the following month. The ECW brand was disbanded in 2010, subsequently deactivating the ECW Championship. In April 2011, WWE ceased going by its full name with the \"WWE\" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism, and the first brand split ended that August.\\n\\nJust prior to the end of the first brand split, a storyline saw CM Punk vowing to leave the company with the WWE Championship when his contract expired on July 17, 2011, the date of the 2011 Money in the Bank pay-per-view. At the event, Punk succeeded in defeating the defending champion John Cena to win the title, and left the company with the physical championship belt. Subsequently, the championship was vacated and Rey Mysterio won an eight-man tournament by defeating The Miz in the finals to be crowned the new WWE Champion, only to subsequently lose it later that night to Cena, for the latter\\'s record ninth reign. However, following Cena\\'s win, Punk returned to WWE with his own championship belt, disputing Cena\\'s claim to the title.[17] The two WWE Champions wrestled each other at SummerSlam; Punk defeated Cena to solidify his claim on the title.\\n\\nTitle reunified and second brand split\\n\\nFour-time champion Daniel Bryan, shown with the 2013–2014 version of the championship belt (in his right hand) and the Big Gold Belt, which were used in tandem to represent the unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship from December 2013 to August 2014\\n\\nFollowing the end of the first brand split in August 2011, both the WWE Champion and World Heavyweight Champion could appear on both Raw and SmackDown. In November 2013, the night after Survivor Series, reigning World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to reigning WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine WWE\\'s undisputed world champion. Orton defeated Cena in a TLC match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to unify the titles. Subsequently, the unified championship was renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship and retained the lineage of the WWE Championship; the World Heavyweight Championship was retired.[18] Orton and subsequent champions held both championship belts until a single championship belt was given to reigning champion Brock Lesnar in August 2014.[19]\\n\\nAfter Dean Ambrose became champion in June 2016, the title\\'s name was reverted to WWE Championship.[20][21][22] In light of the return of the brand split the following month, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown. Ambrose then retained his title at Battleground on July 24 against Raw draftees Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, making the title exclusive to SmackDown.[23] On the July 25 episode of Raw, to address the lack of a world title for the brand, the WWE Universal Championship was created; Finn Bálor became the inaugural champion at SummerSlam.[24] After the unveiling of the Universal title, the WWE Championship was renamed WWE World Championship,[25][26] but reverted to WWE Championship in December 2016 during AJ Styles\\' first reign.[27]\\n\\nThe title changed hands for the first time outside of North America when AJ Styles defeated Jinder Mahal to win his second WWE Championship in Manchester, England on the November 7, 2017, episode of SmackDown. This was also the first time in nearly 15 years that the championship changed hands on an episode of SmackDown; the last time was in 2003 when Brock Lesnar defeated Kurt Angle for the title.[28]\\n\\nAt Crown Jewel on October 31, 2019, SmackDown wrestler \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt won the Universal Championship, thus transferring the title to SmackDown. Also at that event, after reigning WWE Champion Brock Lesnar had defeated Cain Velasquez to retain the title, he was attacked by Raw\\'s Rey Mysterio, who Lesnar had attacked a few weeks prior.[29] The following night on Friday Night SmackDown, Lesnar quit SmackDown and went to Raw to continue his feud with Mysterio, thus transferring the WWE Championship to Raw.[30]\\n\\nAt WrestleMania 38 Night 2 on April 3, 2022, SmackDown\\'s Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated reigning WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to claim both championships and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. WWE had billed the match as a championship unification match; however, both titles have remained independently active with Reigns being a double champion, defending both titles together across both brands as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.[31] On the April 24, 2023, episode of Raw, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced that regardless of what brand Reigns was drafted to in the 2023 WWE Draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand. Triple H subsequently unveiled a new World Heavyweight Championship for the opposing brand, which was won by Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins at Night of Champions.[32][33] As Reigns was drafted to SmackDown, the World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to Raw.[34] On the June 2, 2023, episode of SmackDown, Triple H presented Reigns with a new singular championship belt to represent the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.[35] Amidst confusion of the lineages, Fightful reported that WWE confirmed to them that the two championships are still in fact separate lineages despite Reigns holding only one belt, and that once Reigns loses, the Universal Championship will be dropped in favor of the WWE Championship.[36]\\n\\nBrand designation\\n\\nWith the first brand split, an annual draft was established in 2002. Each year (except 2003), the General Managers participated in a draft lottery in which select members of WWE\\'s roster were assigned to a brand. The revived ECW became a third brand from 2006 to 2010.[37] On August 29, 2011, WWE ended the brand extension and wrestlers (including all champions), were then free to appear on any program.\\n\\nOn July 19, 2016, SmackDown moved to Tuesdays and became a live show with its own set of wrestlers and writers, separate from Raw, thus reintroducing the brand split. The draft took place on the live premiere of SmackDown.[38] On the July 18 episode of Raw, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon named Daniel Bryan the SmackDown General Manager and Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon named Mick Foley the Raw General Manager.[22][39]\\n\\nBelow is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the WWE Championship between the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\\n\\nChampionship belt designs\\n\\n1963–1982\\n\\nBruno Sammartino with the original title belt used to represent the then-WWWF World Heavyweight Championship\\n\\nWhen introduced in 1963, the original WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was represented by a United States championship belt that Buddy Rogers had defended in various territories prior to becoming the inaugural WWWF world champion. The center plate of this belt was an outline of the continental United States and there were two shield-shaped side plates with grapplers on them; the plates were on a red leather strap. On the center plate, there was a circle flanked by grapplers, and the circle was designed to contain a photograph of the titleholder. Above the circle was a shield with an eagle atop it with stars on opposite sides of the shield. The caption \"World\\'s Champion\" was added below the circle. This title belt was worn by the inaugural champion Buddy Rogers in 1963 and the second champion Bruno Sammartino.[46]\\n\\nAfter Sammartino became champion, a new title belt on a blue strap was created and used until 1965. The enlarged center piece contained a crowned globe and two grapplers, and read \"WWWF World Champion\"; the two side plates commemorated Sammartino\\'s title win. This belt was stolen in September 1965; a new belt was created with a mostly similar design with a couple of minor differences with the design of the side plates. This is the most recognizable version of Sammartino\\'s belt that was used until 1971 and has been called the \"holy grail of professional wrestling artifacts\". After defeating Sammartino in January 1971, Ivan Koloff held Sammartino\\'s belt for three weeks before losing it to Pedro Morales.[47][48][49][50]\\n\\n\"Superstar\" Billy Graham with his red leather variation of the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in 1977\\n\\nDuring Morales\\'s reign, the championship belt was updated several times. First in 1971, this design was on an indigo colored strap and contained three shield-shaped plates. Below the center plate, which read \"World Heavyweight Champion\" and had a cross at its center, a separate horizontal plate read \"WWWF\". This was replaced with another design in 1972. This version, on a red strap, read \"WWWF Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\" around the edges with an eagle at the center, while six side plates represented several countries. 1973 saw the introduction of another yet similar design; this one was on a black strap and contained two grapplers above a differently designed eagle. This version was subsequently held by Stan Stasiak, Bruno Sammartino, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham – who wore a red leather variation – and Bob Backlund. During the latter\\'s reign, the promotion\\'s name was shortened to World Wrestling Federation (WWF), but the physical championship belt still read \"WWWF\".[49][50]\\n\\n1982–2005\\n\\nEight-time champion The Rock with the \"Big Eagle\"/\"Attitude Era\" (1998–2002) version of the then-WWF Championship; this design was used in tandem with the Big Gold Belt to represent the Undisputed Championship from December 2001 until April 2002\\n\\nAfter the previous design was destroyed, a new design was introduced in January 1983, nicknamed the \"Big Green Belt\" due to its size and the color of its strap. This was the first to be created under the WWF name. It included eight (later ten) side plates dedicated to the previous champions. The center plate featured a wrestler holding up a championship belt with a globe behind him. This design, held by Bob Backlund, The Iron Sheik, and Hulk Hogan, was replaced first by the \"Hogan \\'84\" design during the spring of 1984, then by the nearly identical \"Hogan \\'85\" design, which first appeared at WrestleMania 1. Both were called \"Hogan\" belts as they were only worn by Hulk Hogan, and they were similar in design to the NWA Television Championship at the time. The \\'84 belt consisted of a dual-plated gold and silver main plate as well as two dual-plated side plates on each side. The main plate was engraved with red lettering. The \\'85 belt had a silver and black main plate with raised silver lettering and the same side plates as the \\'84 belt. Both belts included black straps. Both center plates read \"WWF\" at the top, below that was an eagle with two banners below it reading \"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\". The bottom read \"World Wrestling Federation\" and above that was a name plate commemorating Hogan\\'s title win, while the side plates noted previous champions. In October 1985, a new belt was introduced and was again only worn by Hogan. This belt is erroneously known as the \"Hogan \\'86\" belt. The center plate featured a globe in the center, along with Roman columns and olive branches. It read \"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\" and included the famous WWF block logo at the top, while four side plates had flags (two flags per side plate) representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Italy.[49][50]\\n\\nOn February 5, 1988, just before ending his first championship reign, Hogan introduced another new design, the \"Winged Eagle\" championship belt, which became the primary design for the next decade with many wrestlers holding this version, and is considered the most popular design of the championship. Its nickname is derived from the eagle\\'s wings seemingly coming off of the center plate, which included the block WWF logo and read \"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\". The championship belt also had four identical side plates. Apart from the usual black leather strap, The Ultimate Warrior wore white, light blue, yellow, and purple variations, with the latter also worn by Sgt. Slaughter. In March 1998, after Stone Cold Steve Austin became champion, he was presented with a new design, often dubbed the \"Big Eagle\" or \"Attitude Era\" championship belt. The center plate was similar to the previous design, but became fully rounded, and the side plates were updated with the inner side plates containing the McMahon family crest of a lion holding a shield that had the WWF logo. When it was unveiled, it originally contained the block WWF logo and was on a blue strap, but was updated in November 1998 to the WWF scratch logo and on a black strap. In addition to the logo, it read \"World Wrestling Federation Champion\".[49][50]\\n\\n\\n\\nTop: Lesnar with the Undisputed Championship belt (2002–2005); he was the last Undisputed Champion as the title became the WWE Championship in September 2002\\n\\nBottom: Lesnar with the \"Network Logo\" belt (2014–present); he was the first wrestler to hold this design Seven-time and youngest champion Brock Lesnar Lesnar with the Undisputed Championship belt (2002–2005); he was the last Undisputed Champion as the title became the WWE Championship in September 2002Lesnar with the \"Network Logo\" belt (2014–present); he was the first wrestler to hold this design\\n\\nAfter Chris Jericho unified the WWF and World Championships into the Undisputed WWF Championship, the \"Big Eagle\" championship belt was used in tandem with the \"Big Gold Belt\", the former WCW Championship belt, until a single Undisputed Championship belt was introduced to champion Triple H on the April 1, 2002, episode of Raw.[12] This new belt, dubbed the \"Undisputed Championship Belt\", was designed by New York-based tattoo artist Keith Ciaramello. Taking inspiration from WCW, this design included a name plate, and like the previous two designs, it had an eagle atop the globe. There were also stars seemingly shooting out from the globe. It originally had the WWF scratch logo and read \"World Wrestling Federation Champion\"; after the promotion was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002, both the scratch logo and wording were changed accordingly. The inner side plates on this design also contained the McMahon family crest of a lion holding a shield that had the company logo.[51] The championship would drop the \"undisputed\" moniker in September 2002, becoming the WWE Championship again when it became exclusive to SmackDown!, while the Big Gold Belt was resurrected to represent the World Heavyweight Championship for Raw.[49][50]\\n\\n2005–2014\\n\\nThe Rock unveiling the \"Big Logo\" (2013–2014) version of the WWE Championship\\n\\nAfter John Cena won the WWE Championship in April 2005, he introduced his own custom belt, the \"Spinner Belt\", which had a gold and diamond bling-bling style reflecting his hip hop character at the time. Although originally a custom belt for Cena, it became the WWE Championship\\'s primary design from April 12, 2005, until February 18, 2013. The scratch WWE logo, placed between an eagle on top and the word \"Champ\" and a name plate below, could be spun like spinner wheels or a turntable in keeping with the hip-hop theme. The WWE logo was encrusted with diamonds while other parts of the championship were emblazoned with various other jewels. The inner side plates read \"WWE Champion\", though before 2008, one side plate indicated the brand the title was designated to. The spinning function was phased out in later years and the logo set in a fixed place, most notably during The Miz\\'s first reign (2010–2011) when the logo was turned upside down to look like an \"M\".[50]\\n\\nOn the February 18, 2013, episode of Raw, The Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship belt, often dubbed the \"Big Logo Belt\".[49] The new title was partially designed by Orange County Choppers of American Chopper fame, as well as well-known belt maker Dave Millican.[52] The championship included a large cut-out of the scratch WWE logo (encrusted with diamonds) inside a large irregular heptagonal plate. The word \"Champion\" appeared in a large gold banner underneath the logo. Gold divider bars separated the center plate from its two large side plates. The side plates featured a removable center section that could be customized with the champion\\'s logo in lieu of a nameplate; the default side plates consisted of a red globe with the WWE logo on the globe underneath a crown.[53][50]\\n\\nAfter Randy Orton unified the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the \"Big Logo Belt\" was used in tandem with the \"Big Gold Belt\" to represent the renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship.[54][49]\\n\\n2014–present\\n\\nOn the August 18, 2014, episode of Raw, reigning champion Brock Lesnar, who had won the title the night before at SummerSlam, was presented with a single championship belt, retiring the Big Gold Belt in the process. This new standard belt, often dubbed the \"Network Logo\" belt, has a slightly updated design from the belt introduced by The Rock in 2013 as a result of WWE changing their corporate logo which was originally used for the WWE Network. It includes a large center plate dominated by a cut out of the current WWE logo (encrusted with diamonds) inside an irregular heptagon with the capital words \"World Heavyweight Champion\" along the bottom edges, in very small print. The belt retains the gold divider bars introduced in the previous design. The large side plates, like the previous design, include removable round center sections, allowing the holder\\'s personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default plates show gold and red world maps with the WWE logo over them but without the crown from the previous design. Customizable side plates have now become a prominent feature with the majority of WWE\\'s championship belts.[b][19][49][50]\\n\\nThe \"Network Logo\" design would become a blueprint for WWE\\'s men\\'s and women\\'s world championships, with the only differences being the name at the bottom of the center plate and the colors, as well as the women\\'s being smaller. First was the WWE Women\\'s Championship in April 2016,[55] which became the Raw Women\\'s Championship later that year, although it reverted to its original name in June 2023.[56] After the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown as a result of the 2016 brand split, the design would also be used for the WWE Universal Championship that was introduced for the Raw brand.[57] The design was also used for the SmackDown Women\\'s Championship introduced in August[58] until that title received a new design in June 2023 when it was renamed as Women\\'s World Championship.[59] The NXT United Kingdom Championship and NXT UK Women\\'s Championship belts also used the same base outline but with a different design on the center plate itself.[60][61] After the introduction of the Universal Championship, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship subsequently reverted to being called the WWE Championship, although from July to December 2016, it was called the \"WWE World Championship\";[62][63][64][65][66][67] however, the physical belt has retained the text \"World Heavyweight Champion\".\\n\\nCustom designs\\n\\nThe Rock pictured with Stone Cold Steve Austin\\'s custom \"Smoking Skull\" belt after he had stolen it from Austin in storyline in 1999\\n\\nCustom championship belts have been created to honor certain reigning champions or match their characters. During Hogan\\'s reign in 1986, he had a modified version of the Hogan \\'86 made, which included a picture of himself at the center. Not much is known about this \"mystery belt\" as he quickly reverted to the Hogan \\'86 version. A much larger version similar to the Hogan \\'86 championship belt was created for André the Giant before WrestleMania III, although he never wore it as champion.[68][49]\\n\\nFour-time champion Edge, pictured with his custom \"Rated-R Spinner\" belt that he used during his second reign in 2006\\n\\nA custom championship belt was used by Stone Cold Steve Austin during his second reign (1998), which included his \"Smoking Skull\" logo as well as rattle snakes. As an answer, The Rock also had a custom championship belt designed and constructed, including his trademark \"Brahma Bull\" logo, but due to creative reasons, it never appeared on television.[51] The Spinner Belt, originally a customized belt for John Cena, remained the standard title belt from 2005 to 2013. During Edge\\'s second reign in 2006, he introduced his own variation, the \"Rated R Spinner\" design, replacing the WWE scratch logo with his \"Rated R Superstar\" logo. Edge was going to have a completely new custom belt designed, but due to time constraints, it did not get made.[69][49] During Daniel Bryan\\'s fourth reign (2018–2019) as part of his environmentalist heel gimmick, he threw the standard title belt in a garbage can (bemoaning the fact it was made from leather) and introduced a new custom belt, dubbed the \"Planet\\'s Championship\", featuring the same design as the \"Network Logo\" belt, but made from \"entirely sustainable materials\" (such as the strap being made from hemp and the center and side plates carved from wood of a naturally fallen oak tree; the side plates also had his name instead of the WWE logo).[70]\\n\\nAfter Roman Reigns became the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022, both the standard versions of the WWE Championship and Universal Championship belts were used in tandem to represent the undisputed title, although both titles retained their individual lineages. On the June 2, 2023, episode of SmackDown, in celebration of Reigns reaching 1,000 days as Universal Champion, he was presented with a special custom belt, which features the same \"Network Logo\" design on a black strap, but with the WWE logo encrusted with black diamonds, a gold nugget-textured background behind the logo, text at the bottom of the plate that says \"Undisputed Champion\", and custom side plates.[35] Despite this, his manager Paul Heyman had continued to carry around the standard WWE and Universal Championship belts until the end of July.[71] On WWE\\'s website, pictures of the standard titles are still used for the individual title histories of each championship.\\n\\nOther sports championship belts\\n\\nIn October 2014, WWE presented the San Francisco Giants a replica of the \"Network Logo\" belt for winning the 2014 World Series.[72][73] This began a tradition for WWE, and they have since created custom WWE Championship belts for winners in professional sports, with the side plates commemorating the achievement. They have also presented a custom belt to exceptionally notable people for their efforts in their profession.[74] WWE had originally presented custom WWE Championships to winners in both male and female sports, but in 2018, they began presenting those in female sports with custom Raw Women\\'s Championship belts.[75]\\n\\nSince that original gift in 2014, WWE has presented custom WWE Championship belts to winners of the World Series,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Super Bowl,[82][83][84][85][86] NBA Finals,[87][88][89][90][91][92] FIFA Women\\'s World Cup,[93] College Football Playoff National Championship,[94] Stanley Cup Finals,[95][96][97][98] Australian Open,[99] Premier League,[100][101] Bundesliga,[102] Indian Premier League,[103] Liga MX,[104] Argentine Primera División,[105] Major League Baseball Home Run Derby,[106] Formula One World Championship,[107] UEFA Champions League,[108] Overwatch League,[109] Cricket World Cup,[110] Men\\'s US Open,[111] and Canadian Football League Grey Cup.[112] WWE also presented a title to London police officer Charlie Guenigault for his \"exceptional bravery\" during the 2017 London Bridge attack,[113] and to the U.S. servicemen and women who have helped in hosting WWE Tribute to the Troops (since 2015) as well as for their continued service to the country.[114][115][116][117] In 2020, WWE Championship belts were also presented to Christophe Agius and Philippe Chéreau, WWE announcers in France for 20 consecutive years presenting WWE on French television.[118]\\n\\nReigns\\n\\nFour-time and current champion Roman Reigns, shown here with both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship belts carried by Paul Heyman (right).\\n\\nThe WWE Championship was the first world championship introduced into the promotion in 1963. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers, and there have been 54 different official champions overall and 11 vacancies.[119] The longest reigning champion is Bruno Sammartino, who held the title from May 17, 1963, to January 18, 1971, for a total of 2,803 days (7 years, 8 months, and 1 day); Sammartino also holds the record for longest combined reign at 4,040 days.[120] André the Giant is the shortest reigning champion, officially holding the title for 1 minute, 48 seconds due to selling the title to Ted DiBiase following his title win.[2] The youngest champion is Brock Lesnar, who won the title for the first time at the age of 25 years, 44 days during Summerslam 2002 in August 2002, while the oldest champion is Mr. McMahon, who won the title for the first and only time at the age of 54 years, 21 days during the September 16, 1999 episode of Smackdown. John Cena holds the record for most reigns with 13 which occurred between 2005 and 2017.[119]\\n\\nRoman Reigns is the current champion in his fourth reign. He won the title by defeating previous champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match for both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship, the latter which Reigns defended, on April 3, 2022, at WrestleMania 38 Night 2 in Arlington, Texas. With both championships, Reigns is referred to as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.[119]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNotes'},\n",

       "  'text': 'WWE is an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut, and the world\\'s largest promotion. As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE promotes several championships, with titleholders typically determined via the results of professional wrestling matches within scripted storylines. On rare occasions, a championship may be awarded to or stripped from a wrestler outside of a match, though these occurrences also fall within scripted storylines.[a]\\n\\nWWE currently divides its roster between three brands. Most wrestlers compete exclusively on a single brand (with select exemptions). WWE\\'s two primary brands are Raw and SmackDown, collectively referred to as the main roster. NXT serves as the developmental brand (although it was considered a third main brand from 2019 to 2021).[1]\\n\\nThere are currently 15 championships in WWE divided among the three brands. Raw has one primary and secondary championship for male wrestlers, and a singles championship for female wrestlers. SmackDown has two primary championships (jointly held and defended as an undisputed championship) and a secondary championship for male wrestlers, and a singles championship for female wrestlers. There are two tag team championships for male wrestlers on the main roster, which are held and defended jointly across both brands as an undisputed championship. NXT features a primary, secondary, specialty, and tag team championship for male wrestlers, and a singles championship for female wrestlers. There is one tag team championship in WWE for female wrestlers, which is shared by all three brands.\\n\\nAs of February 9, 2024, among the three current brands, 16 wrestlers officially hold championships (including three double champions). This list includes the number of times the wrestler has held the title, the date and location of the win, and a description of title victory.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThe American professional wrestling promotion WWE currently divides its roster into what the company refers to as brands. The two main brands that the company promotes are Raw and SmackDown, collectively referred to as the main roster. Wrestlers assigned to the two main brands exclusively compete on the respective weekly television programs, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown, albeit with some exceptions. The Raw brand also has a supplementary online streaming program called Main Event. Monthly pay-per-view and livestreaming events feature wrestlers from both brands.\\n\\nNXT is WWE\\'s developmental brand, which is where newer WWE wrestlers perform to potentially be promoted to the main roster. Wrestlers assigned to NXT exclusively compete on the weekly television program, NXT, albeit with some exceptions, as well as the brand\\'s supplementary online streaming program called Level Up. NXT also has its own major livestreaming events held periodically throughout the year.\\n\\nMain roster\\n\\nFor the men\\'s division, Raw features a primary and secondary championship, while SmackDown features two jointly held and defended primary titles (promoted as an undisputed championship) and a secondary title. There are also two jointly held and defended tag team championships—one representing each brand—promoted as an undisputed tag team championship open to both Raw and SmackDown.\\n\\nFor the women\\'s division, each brand has a primary championship. There is also a tag team championship shared between both brands as well as NXT.\\n\\nMen\\n\\nAt the top of WWE\\'s championship hierarchy for male wrestlers are the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on SmackDown—regarded as world heavyweight championships. The World Heavyweight Championship is held by Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, who became the inaugural champion by defeating AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.[2] The Undisputed WWE Universal Championship is held by Roman Reigns and consists of the WWE Championship and the WWE Universal Championship, with both titles being jointly defended but retaining their individual lineages. He won his second Universal Championship by defeating previous champion \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman, who Reigns pinned, in a No Holds Barred triple threat match at Payback on August 30, 2020,[3] and then became undisputed champion by defeating Brock Lesnar to win his fourth WWE Championship on April 3, 2022, on Night 2 of WrestleMania 38 in a Winner Takes All match. The Undisputed WWE Universal Championship was available to both brands but became exclusive to SmackDown as a result of the 2023 WWE Draft.[4]\\n\\nSecondary titles for male wrestlers include the Intercontinental Championship on Raw and the United States Championship on SmackDown. The Intercontinental Championship is held by first-time champion Gunther, who defeated Ricochet on the June 10, 2022, episode of SmackDown; at this time, the title was part of the SmackDown brand.[5] The United States Championship is held by Logan Paul, who is in his first reign. He defeated previous champion Rey Mysterio at Crown Jewel on November 4, 2023.[6]\\n\\nTag team titles for male wrestlers include the Raw Tag Team Championship and the SmackDown Tag Team Championship—both regarded as world tag team championships. Since May 20, 2022, both titles have been held and jointly defended under the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship banner but maintain their individual lineages, with the holders of the undisputed championship allowed to appear on both brands. The Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship is held by The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) from Raw, who are in their second reign, both as a team and individually with each set of titles. They defeated Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso on Raw on October 16, 2023.[7][8]\\n\\nWomen\\n\\nAt the top of WWE\\'s championship hierarchy for female wrestlers are the Women\\'s World Championship on Raw and the WWE Women\\'s Championship on SmackDown—both regarded as women\\'s world championships. The Women\\'s World Championship is held by first-time champion Rhea Ripley, who defeated Charlotte Flair on April 1, 2023, at WrestleMania 39 Night 1. She won the title as the SmackDown Women\\'s Championship and it was renamed as the Women\\'s World Championship on June 12, 2023.[9] The WWE Women\\'s Championship is held by first-time champion Iyo Sky, who defeated Bianca Belair in her Money in the Bank cash-in match at SummerSlam on August 5, 2023.[10]\\n\\nThe women\\'s tag team championship is the WWE Women\\'s Tag Team Championship, which is shared between Raw, SmackDown, and NXT. It is held by The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) from SmackDown, who are in their record tying second reign as a team. Individually, this is the record fourth reign for Asuka and second for Sane. They defeated Katana Chance and Kayden Carter on the January 26, 2024, episode of SmackDown.[11]\\n\\nDevelopmental\\n\\nNXT\\n\\nNXT features four championships for men and two for women. Each gender division has a primary championship. The men\\'s division also has a secondary, specialty, and tag team championship. The women\\'s tag team championship (listed above) is available to Raw, SmackDown, and NXT.\\n\\nMen\\n\\nThe top title for male wrestlers is the NXT Championship. It is held by first-time champion Ilja Dragunov. He defeated Carmelo Hayes on September 30, 2023, at No Mercy.[12]\\n\\nThe secondary championship for male wrestlers is the NXT North American Championship. It is held by first-time champion Oba Femi, who defeated SmackDown\\'s Dragon Lee in his NXT Breakout Tournament contract cash-in match on the January 9, 2024, episode of NXT. [13]\\n\\nThe specialty championship for men is the NXT Heritage Cup. It is defended like any other championship but all matches are contested under British Rounds Rules. It is held by record three-time champion Noam Dar, who defeated Nathan Frazer by 2–1 to win the title on August 22, 2023, at NXT: Heatwave.[14]\\n\\nThe men\\'s tag team championship is the NXT Tag Team Championship. It is held by two-time champions The Family (Tony D\\'Angelo and Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo), who defeated Chase University (Andre Chase and Duke Hudson) on the November 14, 2023, episode of NXT.[15]\\n\\nWomen\\n\\nThe top title for female wrestlers is the NXT Women\\'s Championship.

There is also a tag team championship shared between both brands as well as NXT.\\n\\nMen\\n\\nAt the top of WWE\\'s championship hierarchy for male wrestlers are the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on SmackDown—regarded as world heavyweight championships. The World Heavyweight Championship is held by Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, who became the inaugural champion by defeating AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.[2] The Undisputed WWE Universal Championship is held by Roman Reigns and consists of the WWE Championship and the WWE Universal Championship, with both titles being jointly defended but retaining their individual lineages. He won his second Universal Championship by defeating previous champion \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman, who Reigns pinned, in a No Holds Barred triple threat match at Payback on August 30, 2020,[3] and then became undisputed champion by defeating Brock Lesnar to win his fourth WWE Championship on April 3, 2022, on Night 2 of WrestleMania 38 in a Winner Takes All match.

The Intercontinental Championship is held by first-time champion Gunther, who defeated Ricochet on the June 10, 2022, episode of SmackDown; at this time, the title was part of the SmackDown brand.[5] The United States Championship is held by Logan Paul, who is in his first reign. He defeated previous champion Rey Mysterio at Crown Jewel on November 4, 2023.[6]\\n\\nTag team titles for male wrestlers include the Raw Tag Team Championship and the SmackDown Tag Team Championship—both regarded as world tag team championships. Since May 20, 2022, both titles have been held and jointly defended under the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship banner but maintain their individual lineages, with the holders of the undisputed championship allowed to appear on both brands. The Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship is held by The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) from Raw, who are in their second reign, both as a team and individually with each set of titles.
